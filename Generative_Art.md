## Generative_art

Generative art refers to the creation of visual or audio-visual artwork through the use of algorithms, often implemented by computers or other autonomous ayatems. It involves the use of programming, mathematics, and sometimes artificial intelligence to produce images, animations,
and sometimes artifical intelligence to produce images, animations, or even music that would not be possible through traditional artistic methods alone. Here are some hey aspects of generative art:

**1. Algorithmic Creation:**
     Generative art relies on algorithms, which are sets of rules and procedures that dictate how the artwork is generated.

**2. Randomness and Variation:**
     Many generative art systems incorporate elements of randomness or variation, introducting unpredictability into the artistic process.

**3. Procedural Generation:**
     Procedural generation involves creating art through a series of defined steps or procedures.
